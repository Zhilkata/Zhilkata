I hope that you'll find something useful or interesting here. This is my only profile on GitHub, so any project that I'm serious about is maintained in this place.

# 🖥️ Technical Interests
I study both at UniBIT and SoftUni, but for many things I'm self-taught. There are so many readily available books, courses and simply videos, full of knowledge and guidance, that I don't think a formal education is required by any means, other than to help a recruiter check their boxes faster. Thus, my interests are varied:

**✍️ Languages**:
* C#
* Python
* C++
* JavaScript
* GDScript(_only in work with Godot Game Engine_)

**📱 Platforms**:
* Android
* Windows
* Linux

**⚙️ Game Dev Engines/Frameworks**:
* Unity
* Unreal Engine 3/ 4 / 5
* Godot
* Pygame

**🎨 Art/Design**:
* Animation
* Pixel Art
* Architecture
* Game Design & Gamification
* Game Engine Development & Optimisation

# 📚 Non-Technical Interests
### 🎮
It's obvious that I take deep interest in video games, not only mindlessly playing them, but also analysing, breaking them down by elements, and trying to understand and gather ideas, concepts, methodologies, and so on. 

### 🏋️
I also love working out, eating well and taking care of my health in other ways, believing that a strong mind in a weak body is as useless as the other way around.

### 📖
I love reading a lot of books, both fictional(fantasy, horror/thriller, historical fiction) and non-fictional(history, philosophy, biographies).

### 🎹 
A hobby I've picked up a couple of years ago is music composition and sound design, applicable in many fields and a good variety for a programmer.

### 🎥
I also record and edit videos
